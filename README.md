# gitinbash
Customized bash prompt with git repository info.

It looks like:
directory [master] 2✗ 1• 2✓ $

where the first digit (red) displays count of untracked files,
the second digit (yellow) displays count of modified files
(not staged for commit) and the third digit (green) displays count of staged
files (to be commited).

Copy content of "bashrc" to end of your bash file and be happy :)
